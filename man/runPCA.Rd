}
\value{
For \code{calculatePCA}, a numeric matrix of coordinates for each cell (row) in each of \code{ncomponents} PCs (column).

For \code{runPCA}, a SingleCellExperiment object is returned containing this matrix in \code{\link{reducedDims}(..., name)}.

In both cases, the attributes of the PC coordinate matrix contain the following elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{"percentVar"}, the percentage of variance explained by each PC.
This may not sum to 100 if not all PCs are reported.
\item \code{"varExplained"}, the actual variance explained by each PC.
\item \code{"rotation"}, the rotation matrix containing loadings for all genes used in the analysis and for each PC.
}
}
\description{
Perform a principal components analysis (PCA) on cells, 
based on the expression data in a SingleCellExperiment object.
}
\details{
Fast approximate SVD algorithms like \code{BSPARAM=IrlbaParam()} or \code{RandomParam()} use a random initialization, after which they converge towards the exact PCs.
This means that the result will change slightly across different runs.
For full reproducibility, users should call \code{\link{set.seed}} prior to running \code{runPCA} with such algorithms.
(Note that this includes \code{BSPARAM=\link{bsparam}()}, which uses approximate algorithms by default.)

\section{Feature selection}{

This section is relevant if \code{x} is a numeric matrix of (log-)expression values with features in rows and cells in columns;
or if \code{x} is a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} and \code{dimred=NULL}.
In the latter, the expression values are obtained from the assay specified by \code{exprs_values}.

The \code{subset_row} argument specifies the features to use for dimensionality reduction.
The aim is to allow users to specify highly variable features to improve the signal/noise ratio,
or to specify genes in a pathway of interest to focus on particular aspects of heterogeneity.

If \code{subset_row=NULL}, the \code{ntop} features with the largest variances are used instead.
We literally compute the variances from the expression values without considering any mean-variance trend,
so often a more considered choice of genes is possible, e.g., with \pkg{scran} functions.
Note that the value of \code{ntop} is ignored if \code{subset_row} is specified.

If \code{scale=TRUE}, the expression values for each feature are standardized so that their variance is unity.
This will also remove features with standard deviations below 1e-8.
}

\section{Using reduced dimensions}{

If \code{x} is a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment}, the method can be applied on existing dimensionality reduction results in \code{x} by setting the \code{dimred} argument.
This is typically used to run slower non-linear algorithms (t-SNE, UMAP) on the results of fast linear decompositions (PCA).
We might also use this with existing reduced dimensions computed from \emph{a priori} knowledge (e.g., gene set scores), where further dimensionality reduction could be applied to compress the data.

The matrix of existing reduced dimensions is taken from \code{\link{reducedDim}(x, dimred)}.
By default, all dimensions are used to compute the second set of reduced dimensions.
If \code{n_dimred} is also specified, only the first \code{n_dimred} columns are used.
Alternatively, \code{n_dimred} can be an integer vector specifying the column indices of the dimensions to use.

When \code{dimred} is specified, no additional feature selection or standardization is performed.
This means that any settings of \code{ntop}, \code{subset_row} and \code{scale} are ignored.

If \code{x} is a numeric matrix, setting \code{transposed=TRUE} will treat the rows as cells and the columns as the variables/diemnsions.
This allows users to manually pass in dimensionality reduction results without needing to wrap them in a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment}.
As such, no feature selection or standardization is performed, i.e., \code{ntop}, \code{subset_row} and \code{scale} are ignored.
}

\section{Using alternative Experiments}{

This section is relevant if \code{x} is a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} and \code{altexp} is not \code{NULL}.
In such cases, the method is run on data from an alternative \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} nested within \code{x}.
This is useful for performing dimensionality reduction on other features stored in \code{\link{altExp}(x, altexp)}, e.g., antibody tags. 

Setting \code{altexp} with \code{exprs_values} will use the specified assay from the alternative SummarizedExperiment.
If the alternative is a SingleCellExperiment, setting \code{dimred} will use the specified dimensionality reduction results from the alternative. 
This option will also interact as expected with \code{n_dimred}.

Note that the output is still stored in the \code{\link{reducedDims}} of the output SingleCellExperiment.
It is advisable to use a different \code{name} to distinguish this output from the results generated from the main experiment's assay values.
